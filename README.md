# Irrational Exuberance

## Exploratory Data Analysis of the Secondary Watch Market

### Background
The idea of spending thousands on a wristwatch really doesnt make any sense. But given the price if rare pokemon cards, dog-themed crypto currencies, and jpegs of monkeys, I dont really know what to think anymore. 

To get better insight on the secondary market of watches, I have scraped the contents of chronext.com, a website used to buy and sell used watches. I ended up with 4463 listings that were available for sale as of November 27, 2021.


## Guess the prices 

Before diving into the data, see if you can guess the prices of these watches

The data shown in the chart does not tell the whole story because many different aspects play a role in the secondary market of the watch, such as materials used and condition. Also, it is important to note that while older watches may be technically worse than newer ones, due to their rare nature and the irrational behavior of collectors, are often valued higher. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

But comparing the exact same reference of watch below shows the madness. The difference shows the premium to have this watch now and not deal with the AD's. If you were able to purchase this watch at retail, you could almost double your money walking out of the door.
