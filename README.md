# Irrational Exuberance

## Exploratory Data Analysis of the Secondary Watch Market

### Background
Bubbles are not new. 

But unlike the more useful assets, such as pokemon cards, dog-themed crypto currencies, and jpegs of monkeys, another anachronistic commodity has been gaining steam. Watches. 

Like most people before the pandemic, I used to give a shit about my appearence. Starting a new job out of college, I thought I would seem more professional with a shiny new wristwatch. This is when I fell down the horological rabit hole. The community of watch enthusiats may not be super wide. However, it runs extremely deep, with people obsessing over all matter of detail. Many cite historical significance as an important factor in evaluating the value of a watch. Others appreciate the mechanical aspect in our digital world. There is no denying that hype is also driving up demand. There almost seems to be a blending of traditional high end fasion intrigue and a new age "hypebeast" culture that, at least for certain brands, is making it borderline impossible to purchase certain watches from a retailer. At the time of writing this, authorized dealers of Rolex watches have empty display cases and promises of putting you on a waitlist.

To get better insight on the secondary market of watches, I have scraped the contents of chronext.com, a website used to buy and sell used watches.
